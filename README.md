Gauge
=====

A lightweight measurement framework designed for measuring evaluation criterias in an application.
The architecture of this framework is inspired by the powerful [Metrics][metrics].

The main difference between Gauge and [Metrics][metrics] is that Gauge is far smaller (has less features), and allows the instruments to be reset.
