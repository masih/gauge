/**
 * One or more variables that together maintain an initially zero
 * {@code long} sum.  When updates (method {@link #add}) are contended
 * across threads, the set of variables may grow dynamically to reduce
 * contention. Method {@link #sum} (or, equivalently, {@link
 * #longValue}) returns the current total combined across the
 * variables maintaining the sum.
 * <p>This class is usually preferable to {@link AtomicLong} when
 * multiple threads update a common sum that is used for purposes such
 * as collecting statistics, not for fine-grained synchronization
 * control.  Under low update contention, the two classes have similar
 * characteristics. But under high contention, expected throughput of
 * this class is significantly higher, at the expense of higher space
 * consumption.
 * <p>This class extends {@link Number}, but does <em>not</em> define
 * methods such as {@code equals}, {@code hashCode} and {@code
 * compareTo} because instances are expected to be mutated, and so are
 * not useful as collection keys.
